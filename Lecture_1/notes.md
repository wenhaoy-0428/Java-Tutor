### Package

A package in Java is used to group related classes, it is managed by directory.

1. Java has some built-in packages and multiple packages together forms a **library**. 

```java
import package.name.Class;   // Import a single class
import package.name.*;   // Import the whole package
```

We have a Animal Package
```
Animal
    |__ Cat.java
    |__ Dog.java
    |__ Greetings.java
Main.java
```



### Class Modifiers

There're 2 groups of modifiers

1. **Access Modifiers** - controls the access level
2. **Non-Access Modifiers** - do not control access level, but provides other functionality

```java
public class Main
```

For a class

| Modifier   | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| default    | The class is only accessible by classes in the same package. |
| **public** | The class is accessible by any other class                   |
